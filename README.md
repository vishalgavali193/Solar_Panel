# Solar_Panel

## Overview

The Solar Panel Energy Management System (SPEMS) is designed to optimize energy production, maintenance, and usage of solar panels through innovative features such as solar tracking, self-cleaning mechanisms, and real-time energy monitoring. This project aims to enhance energy efficiency, reduce operational costs, and promote the adoption of renewable energy technologies.

## Features

### 1. Solar Tracking
- Dynamically adjusts solar panel angles to follow the sun's path.
- Increases energy production by up to 25% compared to static systems.

### 2. Self-Cleaning Mechanism
- Employs hydrophobic coatings to automatically remove dirt and debris from solar panels.
- Ensures optimal efficiency and reduces maintenance needs, improving efficiency by up to 15%.

### 3. Real-Time Energy Monitoring
- Continuously tracks energy production and consumption.
- Provides valuable data insights to optimize usage, leading to cost reductions of approximately 10%.
